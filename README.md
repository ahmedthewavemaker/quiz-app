 QUIZ APP


Quiz app designed to implement a soccer player quiz in order to differentiate between true fans and fake ones. 

Users go through a series of questions and select the best fitting answer. In the end, their score (which they can brag about or hide) will be revealed.

Technologies used are Javascript ES6, CSS3, HTML5 and many user interactivity commands implemented.

Discovered that most of my friends and people I have asked to take this quiz in the development phase are not as soccer literate as they thought.

Goals for the future include building a large question base, that is randomized to display a few to avoid users memorizing questions and having a more updated version of the app to match current events in the soccer world and the latest transfers.
